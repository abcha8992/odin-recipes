            STEPS
        </strong>
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Sauté Aromatics: </strong>Heat olive oil in a large skillet or pot over medium heat. Add chopped onion and sauté until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add minced garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant, being careful not to burn it.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Build the Sauce: 
            </strong>If using, add tomato paste and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Stir in the crushed or diced tomatoes, water or vegetable stock, salt, and pepper. Bring to a gentle simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Cook the Pasta: 
            </strong>While the sauce simmers, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to package directions until al dente (tender but firm to the bite). Remember to save ½ cup of the pasta water before draining the pasta, as it can be used to adjust the sauce consistency later.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Combine & Finish: 
            </strong>Drain the pasta and add it directly to the simmering tomato sauce. Toss to combine and cook for a few more minutes, allowing the pasta to absorb some of the sauce's flavor. If the sauce seems too thick, add a splash of the reserved pasta water to reach your desired consistency.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Serve:
            </strong>  Transfer to plates, garnish with fresh basil leaves if using, and top with grated Parmesan cheese to taste. Serve immediately and enjoy!
